# Steganography

Hide a text document (text.txt) within the same folder as this program
into an image (host_image.jpg). The GUI will show the host image in the
left panel. The hiding will be performed by replacing the ’n’ lower
order bits of image with the ASCII values of the ‘m’ number of
characters from the text document. The more text you embed into the
image, the lesser the quality the image will be. The GUI will show the
value of ’n’ and ‘m’, where ’n’ can vary from 0 to 8 and ‘m’ can be any
value between 0 and the maximum number of characters that can be
embedded in the image.
